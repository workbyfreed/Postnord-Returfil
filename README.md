# Postnord-Returfil
Helper app for Postnord Returfil.

Swedish companies using The Swedish state owned postal service Postnord may get a return file for undeliverabled or onwarded delivered lettters and parcels stating reason and, where applicable, new address.

This file and format is not easy to interpret so I wrote a small Python script running in a notebook to convert it to a more understandable format. Now I was the only one being able to run this so I decided to create an app with GUI using Python and Tkinter for anyone to run it.

This script can be complied with Pyinstaller or Nuitka or, depending on antivirus protection policies, distributed with Python embedded and run the script from a .bat file.
